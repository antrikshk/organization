## Funding

This repo will grow to be something that discusses the pros & cons people in the FOSS space have encountered amongst the various funding options.

- Crowdfunding
- Grants

### Crowdfunding vs. Grants

This was a list of thoughts made by Greg Slepak [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/573600803383967744) based on his experiences applying for grants vs. crowdfunding.

- Putting aside monetary considerations, crowd funding, IMO, treats everyone involved better than grant writing.
- And even taking monetary considerations into account, on the whole, I think the crowd funding model provides more value to the world.
- Whether you are asking for money or giving money to a cause, crowd funding will treat you and everyone involved better.
- Why? B/c grant writing wastes the time of most applicants, the reviewer's time, and it provides inferior opportunity for communication.
- With grant writing, vast majority receive nothing and will waste time and $. Crowd funding far more likely to provide at least some value
- Notice also: grant writing is a hyper centralized model. Crowd funding is far more decentralized. Decentralization again, proves superior
